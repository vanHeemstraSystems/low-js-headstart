## 100 - Introduction

low.js is a open sourced port of the JavaScript runtime Node.js with far lower system requirements, allowing it to run on cheap, power-efficient microcontroller boards based on the ESP32-WROVER module.

With low.js you can build scalable Internet-native electronics applications (IoT) easily and fast.
